# Simple Restful Webservice for Freelancers Portal

## RESTful Web Services:
RESTful Web Services are basically REST Architecture based Web Services. In REST Architecture everything is a resource. RESTful web services are light weight, highly scalable and maintainable and are very commonly used to create APIs for web-based applications. 

## What is REST?
REST (i.e. Representation State Transfer) is an architectural style for defining our routes. It is a way of mapping HTTP routes and the CRUD functionalities.

## What are routes?
Routes are the code that are responsible for listening and receiving requests and then deciding what to send back.

## What is CRUD?
When building APIs, we want to provide the four basic types of functionality. There must be a way to Create, Read, Update, and Delete resources.
In a REST environment, CRUD often corresponds to the HTTP methods POST, GET, PUT, and DELETE, respectively.
